# Pixel Perfect - Profile Picture Reproduction

## Description
This project is a CSS and HTML exercise aimed at reproducing a model of a profile picture as closely as possible, following the principles of "pixel perfect" design. The goal of the exercise was to mimic the visual appearance of the model provided in Figma with high precision.

## Objectives
- Practice CSS and HTML layout skills.
- Achieve a "pixel perfect" match with the Figma design model.
- Understand and apply design principles to replicate visual elements accurately.

## Features
- **Profile Picture Layout:** Reproduces a profile picture design with detailed attention to alignment, spacing, and proportions.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the layout adapts well across various screen sizes (if applicable).
- **Pixel Perfect Accuracy:** Mimics the Figma design to achieve a nearly indistinguishable result.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.

## Usage
- Open the project in your browser to view the replicated profile picture design.
- Compare the output with the Figma model to assess accuracy.

## Development Process
1. **Analyzing the Design:** Carefully reviewed the Figma design to identify key elements and structure.
2. **Setting Up HTML:** Created semantic HTML structure to represent the profile picture.
3. **Styling with CSS:** Used CSS for precise positioning, styling, and responsiveness to mimic the design.
4. **Fine-Tuning:** Compared the result against the Figma model, adjusting details to achieve pixel-perfect accuracy.

## Challenges
- Achieving precise alignment and spacing.
- Matching colors, shadows, and other visual effects exactly as in the Figma design.

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of precision in CSS and HTML for achieving design accuracy.
- How to interpret and implement design specifications from a Figma file.
